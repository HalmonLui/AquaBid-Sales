# AquaBid-Sales
Scrapes the website www.aquabid.com for general item costs. Useful to analyze market data and market values of each item.
## Why did I want to do this project?
Being an owner of many pets, the only pets I realized I constantly buy and sell for are the fish! There are constantly different mosses and driftwoods in the market and the price shifts up and down. With this script, the goal will be to learn the flow of the market and also keep up with the current market prices for each item (Lows, Highs, Averages).

## What went into this project?
* Language
  * Python3 was definitely the way to go since I wanted to scrape AquaBid and then apply calculations
* Modules
  * BeautifulSoup4 - used along with urllib to scrape the website
  * Regular Expressions (RE) - used to work with wildcard string matching when working with BeautifulSoup
* Database
  * Database will be chosen after the scraping can be accomplished
